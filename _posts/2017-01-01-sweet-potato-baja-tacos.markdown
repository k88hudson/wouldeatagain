directions: |
  1. Chop and mix tomatoes, red onion, some cilantro, and jalapeño to create the pico de gallo. Set aside. Also chop cabbage into very thin slices.
  2. Peel and thinly slice sweet potatoes into rounds, and then cut the rounds in half.
  3. Starting heating about an inch of vegetable oil in a cast iron pan to 350F.
  4. While the oil is heating up, prepare the batter. Mix rice flour, salt, about a half a cup of club soda, and an egg together. Do NOT over mix, a few lumps are OK. The batter should have about the consistency of pancake batter, maybe a bit thicker.
  5. As soon as the oil reaches temperature, start dipping slices of sweet potato into the batter and put them in the oil. Cook each piece for about 3-4 minutes. Do not overcrowd your pan.
  6. Drain the tempura on kitchen paper or a wire rack.
  7. Mix some cilantro, sour cream, avocado, salt, pepper, and lime juice in a food processor. If it's too thick add more lime juice or a bit of water.
  8. Assemble tacos, with a few pieces of sweet potato, avocado crema, cabbage, pico de gallo, and more cilantro. Add hot sauce to taste.

It took a little bit of experimentation, but tempura is actually not too hard to make (and totally worth the effort) as long as you remember a few important things. Make sure your oil is actually hot enough (somewhere between 320F and 360F), using a thermometer if you need to. I used rice flour for these, which makes for a lighter taste and thinner batter, but you can also use half all purpose half rice or corn flour if you'd prefer. Also, make sure your soda water is fizzy and cold. In a pinch, you can add some ice cubes.
