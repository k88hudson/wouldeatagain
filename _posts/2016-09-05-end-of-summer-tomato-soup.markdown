directions: |
  1. Coarsely chop tomatoes and place them with unpeeled cloves of garlic on a cookie sheet. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil and bake at 350F/180C for about an hour.
  2. When the tomatoes are almost done, sauté some onions with a bit of olive oil and herbes de Provence in a large pot.
  3. When the onions have softened, peel the garlic and add it with the tomatoes to the pot. Add fresh thyme and  stock.
  4. Cook the mixture around 20 minutes. See how it tastes, and add salt and pepper to taste.
  5. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until smooth. I like to leave it a bit chunky, but you can strain it if you like.
  6. Serve with chopped fresh basil, a bit of cream, and extra pepper.

I have mixed feelings about the September labour day weekend. On one hand, summer is almost over. On the other hand, we get some of the best weather of the year (not too hot, not too cold), and a whole lot of birthday celebrations in my family — and that means some seriously amazing outdoor barbecue parties.

This is really the first year we've had an outdoor space that can fit more than two or three people, so my partner and I decided to go all in for his birthday and invite two different groups of fifteen over two days. Cooking for that many people is *way* out of my comfort zone, let me tell you! Luckily, we managed to squeeze everyone in, the wine was flowing, the food turned out great, and everyone was super helpful with carrying things between floors. We even had a friend pitch in on the barbecue! I honestly don't think I could be happier.

Of course, lots of food means lots of leftovers. I threw together this soup the day after with all the leftover tomatoes and herbs we had, expecting to freeze it for later – but we liked it so much we just had it all for dinner. You can do this with any kind of tomatoes, but it's really nice with a bit of sweetness from the cherry tomatoes. Enjoy your summer... while it lasts!
